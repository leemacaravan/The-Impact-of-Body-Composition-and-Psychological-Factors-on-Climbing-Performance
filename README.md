The Impact of Body Composition on Climbing Performance
Overview
This repository contains the full paper titled "The Impact of Body Composition on Climbing Performance: Correlations Between Muscle Mass, Grip Strength, and Psychological Factors in Elite and Recreational Female Rock Climbers." The paper explores how various factors such as muscle mass, grip strength, and psychological aspects like fear of falling influence climbing performance among female rock climbers.

The research utilizes both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to investigate the relationships between body composition, psychological factors, and climbing performance. It includes surveys distributed to climbing organization members and performance testing under controlled conditions. Initial findings suggest a positive correlation between higher muscle mass to body fat ratio, improved grip strength, and better climbing performance.
